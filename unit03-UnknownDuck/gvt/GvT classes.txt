The Goats vs. TrollsCCG has been so wildly successful that the 
powers that be have decided to expand the IP into a new video game 
inspired by the classic JRPGs of the 1980s. Your software 
development company has been contracted to develop the highly 
anticipated game. Goats vs. Trolls: The RPG. The player will control a 
party of 4 goats, as they battle against endless waves of enemy trolls. 
Your team will begin its design by focusing on the heroic Goats.
